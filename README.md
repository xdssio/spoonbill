* A `strict=False` mode is available to allow for more flexible data types - anything which is cloudpickle-able will
  work including classes and functions.

## Use cases

Mock data on local dictionary and cloud store in dev or production.

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import DynamoDBStore, InMemoryStore
import os

environment = os.getenv("environment", "test")

if environment == "test":
    store = InMemoryStore.open("mock data")
elif environment == "dev":
    store = DynamoDBStore.open("dev table")
else:
    store = DynamoDBStore.open("prod table")
```

Real-time feature engineering with any backend

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import RedisStore
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'user': [1, 2, 3]})
feature_store = RedisStore.open("features table")  # {1: {"age":20:, "sex":female",...}}


def get_user_details(x):
    default = {"age": 25, "sex": "female"}
    return pd.Series(feature_store.get(x['user'], default).values())


df[['age', 'sex']] = df.apply(get_user_details, axis=1)
df
"""
   user  age     sex
0     1   20    male
1     2   30  female
2     3   25  female
"""
```


## Usage

All the classes have the same interface, so you can use them interchangeably.

* The *strict* argument is used to control if to encode the keys and values with cloudpickle or keep original backend
  behavior. if strict is False, any key and value can be used, otherwise it depends on the backend.

### APIs
Everthying a dict does plus some searches. 

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import InMemoryStore

store = InMemoryStore()
store["key"] = "value"
store["key"] = {"feature": "value"}
store["key"] == "value"
del store['key']
store.set("key", "value")
store.get("key", None)
store.delete("key")
store.pop('key', None)
store.popitem()
store.keys()
store.items()
store.values()
'key' in store  # contains
len(store)
for key in store: pass  # iterate
store.update({'key': 'value'})
store.save('path')
store.load('path')


```

When using `strict=True` we can use some advanced features of the backend. specifically for searches.

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import InMemoryStore

store = InMemoryStore()
store.keys(pattern="*", limit=10)  # scan keys to a pattern
store.values(keys=['key1', 'key2'])  # retrieve a batch of values efficiently 
store.items(conditions={'a': '1+', 'b': 1}, limit=10)  # filter based on match conditions

```

### How to choose a backend?

For fastest performance, use the InMemoryStore. It is a simple dict that is not persisted to disk.      
If you need local persistence, I prefer the LmdbStore, but PysosStore and ShelveStore should work too.

If speed is not important, but you want cheap persistence in the cloud, use FilesystemStore with S3,GCP, or Azure.

If you are using it to load tensors for embedding or deep learning weights, use SafetensorsStore

If you need persistence in the cloud with realtime search, use one of the Providers key-values store:

* CosmosDB (Azure)
* Firestore (GCP)
* DynamoDB (AWS)
* MongoDB (Wherever it is deployed)

If you need very fast realtime, then the RedisStore is the best choice.

# Backends

## InMemoryStore

This object is to have a common interface for all the key-value stores. It is great for testing and for the average use
case, to have a common interface which includes the search operations.

* Save/load are implemented to save/load the whole dict to/from a file, locally or on the cloud
  using [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html?highlight=s3#other-known-implementations).

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import InMemoryStore

store = InMemoryStore()  # InMemoryDict.open() or InMemoryDict.open('path/to/file') from file

# Also works with any dict-like object
from collections import defaultdict, OrderedDict, Counter

store = InMemoryStore(defaultdict)
store = InMemoryStore(OrderedDict)
store = InMemoryStore(Counter)
```

## [LmdbStore](https://github.com/Dobatymo/lmdb-python-dbm)

An LMDB key-value store based on [lmdb-python-dbm](https://github.com/Dobatymo/lmdb-python-dbm). This is ideal for lists
or datastores which either need persistence, are too big to fit in memory or both.   
This is a Python DBM interface style wrapper around [LMDB](http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/) (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database)

[Details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database)

Requirements:   
```pip install lmdbm```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import LmdbStore

store = LmdbStore.open('tmp.db')
```

## [PysosStore](https://github.com/dagnelies/pysos)

This is ideal for lists or dictionaries which either need persistence, are too big to fit in memory or both.

There are existing alternatives like shelve, which are very good too. There main difference with pysos is that:

* only the index is kept in memory, not the values (so you can hold more data than what would fit in memory)
* it provides both persistent dicts and lists
* objects must be json "dumpable" (no cyclic references, etc.)
* it's fast (much faster than shelve on windows, but slightly slower than native dbms on linux)
* it's unbuffered by design: when the function returns, you are sure it has been written on disk
* it's safe: even if the machine crashes in the middle of a big write, data will not be corrupted
* it is platform independent, unlike shelve which relies on an underlying dbm implementation, which may vary from system
  to system the data is stored in a plain text format

Requirements:   
```pip install pysos```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import PysosStore

store = PysosStore.open('tmp.db')
```

## [Shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html)

The difference with “dbm” databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially arbitrary Python
objects — anything that the pickle module can handle. This includes most class instances, recursive data types, and
objects containing lots of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings.

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import ShelveStore

store = ShelveStore.open('tmp.db')
```

## [Safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors)

This is ideal whe you want to work with tensors from disc, but it is a frozen store - no set or update.

Requirements:   
```pip install safetensors```

* if you use tensorflow, torch, numpy or flax, youll need to install them too... duh.

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import SafetensorsStore
import numpy as np

data = {'weight1': np.array([1, 2, 3]), 'weight2': np.array([4, 5, 6])}
SafetensorsStore.export_safetensors(data, 'tmp.db', framework=SafetensorsStore.NUMPY)
store = SafetensorsStore.open('tmp.db', framework=SafetensorsStore.NUMPY, device='cpu')

store['weight1']  # returns a numpy array
store['weight1'] = 1  # raises an error
```

If you must be able to have a mutable store, you can use the `SafetensorsInMemoryStore`.

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import SafetensorsInMemoryStore, SafetensorsStore
import numpy as np

store = SafetensorsInMemoryStore(framework=SafetensorsStore.NUMPY)
store['weight'] = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # backed by an InMemoryStore
safetensors_store = store.export_safetensors("path")
```

In you want a mutable and persisted safetensors, we got you cover with the `SafetensorsLmdbStore` backed by the
LmdbStore backend

* ```pip install lmdbm```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import SafetensorsLmdbStore, SafetensorsStore
import numpy as np

store = SafetensorsLmdbStore(path='tmp.db', framework=SafetensorsStore.NUMPY)
store['weight'] = np.array([1, 2, 3])  # backed by a LmdbStore
safetensors_store = store.export_safetensors("path")
```

## FilesystemStore

This dict is implemented as key-value files locally or on a cloud provider. It is **slow**, but good for as a cheap
persisted key-value store. It is a wrapepr
around [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html#key-value-stores) key-value feature.
Therefor it supports all the filesystems supported by fsspec (s3, gs, az, local, ftp, http, etc).

* It supports caching
* It can be exported to a local directory or other clouds (s3, gs, az, etc)

For faster applications with cloud persistence, you can use InMemoryStore/LmdbStore and save/load to the cloud after
updates.

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import FilesystemStore

# set strict to True to use redis with its default behaviour which turns keys and values to strings
store = FilesystemStore.open("s3://bucket/path/to/store")
store.save("local_dir_path")
```

## [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-py)

Probably the fastest solution for key-value stores not only in python, but in general. It is a great solution.

* When *strict=False* any key-value can be used, otherwise only string keys and values can be used.
* When using keys with patterns -> the pattern is passed to redis *keys* function, so the behaviour is what you would
  expect from redis.
* Redis doesn't have any search for values.

Requirements:   
```pip install redis```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import RedisStore

# set strict to True to use redis with its default behaviour which turns keys and values to strings
store = RedisStore.open("redis://localhost:6379/1")
store[1] = 1
assert store[1] == store["1"] == "1"

assert list(store.keys('1*')) == ['111', '1', '11']  # redis turn every key to string
assert list(store.scan('1*')) == ['111', '1', '11']  # slower but non-blocking

store = RedisStore.open("redis://localhost:6379/1", strict=False)
store[1] = lambda x: x + 1  # anything goes using cloudpickle
assert store[1](1) == 2
```

## Serverless stores

* Recommended to use values as dict values, as they are more efficient to scan.
    * Good Example: `store['key'] = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}`
    * Bad Example: `store['key'] = "a value which is not a dict"`

Recommended using with `strict=True` to enjoy all the benefits of backends including **searches**.

Searches API Example:

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import MongoDBStore

store = MongoDBStore()
store.keys(pattern="*", limit=10)  # scan keys to a pattern
store.values(keys=['key1', 'key2'])  # retrieve a batch of values efficiently 
store.items(conditions={'a': '1+', 'b': 1}, limit=10)  # filter based on match conditions
```

## [MongoDB]((https://www.mongodb.com/home))

* Save/load is only implemented for `strict=True`.

Requirements:
```pip install pymongo```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import MongoDBStore

store = MongoDBStore.open(uri='mongodb://localhost:27017/')
```

## [DynamoDB]((https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/))

Notes:

* It is always recommended to set values which are a dict {attribute_name: value} to enjoy all the dynamodb features.
* Keys are defined per table as either strings ('S'), numbers ('N') or bytes ('B').
* If you set a primitive number value, it will return as float (:
* cerealbox is required for retrieving multiple values with *values(["key1", "key2"])*:
    * ```pip install cerealbox```

Requirements:

```bash
pip install boto3 
```

## [Firestore]((https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore))

Notes:

* It is recommended use dict-values {attribute_name: value} + `strict=True` to enjoy all the firestore features.
    * Example: `store['key'] = {'feature': 'value'}`   
      Prerequisites:

1. Create a project in Google Cloud Platform
2. Enable Firestore API
3. Create a service account and download the json file
4. Set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path of the json file
5. Create a database in Firestore
6. Create a collection in the database
7. Install google-cloud-firestore with

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-cloud-firestore 
```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import Firestore

# this rest of the credentials are picked up from the file in the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable
store = Firestore.open(table_name="my-collection")
```

## [Azure CosmosDB]((https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Azure+Cosmos&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8))

Notes:

* It is recommended use dict-values {attribute_name: value} + `strict=True` to enjoy all the CosmosDB features.
    * Example: `store['key'] = {'feature': 'value'}`
* The scans are implemented with SQL and  `LIKE` (Regex is not implemented on Cosmos). So it is not possible to do
  `store.keys('a*')` but `store.keys('a%')` works.

Prerequisites: [Quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/quickstart-python?tabs=azure-portal%2Clinux)

Requirements:

```pip install azure-cosmos```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import CosmosDBStore

store = CosmosDBStore.open(database='db',
                           container='container',
                           endpoint='endpoint',
                           credential='credential')
```

## [Modal.com](https://modal.com/home)

Requirements:

```
pip install modal-client
modal token new
```

The [modal Dict](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Dict) has a different context than the other stores. For it to
work, we must give it the stub at creation time and the app at runtime.

Currently, modal implemented only *contains*, *put*, *get*, *update*, *len*, and *pop*.    
For the sake of consistency, we implemented the *keys*, *values*, *items* and the search APIs naively with another
metadata modal.Dict, which
makes them slow.

It is recommended to use it mostly as a cache.

The ModalStore is initiated with a **stub** outside the runtime with data optionally and cannot be updated outside the
app
by design.

Within the runtime, the **context app** is passed to the store to be able to update the data.

Within a function, only the **name** of the dict is needed.

```python 
import modal
from spoonbill.datastores import ModalStore

image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("spoonbill-framework")

name = "data"
stub = modal.Stub("app name", **kwargs)
# with stub
store = ModalStore.open(name=name, stub=stub, data={"key": "value"})  # data is optional


@stub.function(image=image)
def foo():
    # in function
    store = ModalStore.open(name=name)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    with stub.run() as app:
        # in stub.run context
        store = ModalStore.open(name=name, app=app) 
``` 

## [UnQlite] (https://unqlite.org)([python-bindings](https://github.com/coleifer/unqlite-python))

Read the issue tracker for this database before considering using it. UnQLite has not seen any meaningful development
since 2014. It is strongly recommended that you use Sqlite. Sqlite has robust support for json and is actively developed
and maintained.

UnQLite is a in-process software library which implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration,
transactional NoSQL database engine.

Requirements:   
```pip install unqlite```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import UnQLiteStore

store = UnQLiteStore.open('tmp.db')  # leave empty for in-memory
```

## [Speedb](https://github.com/speedb-io/speedb)

A first-of-its-kind, community-led key-value storage engine, designed to support modern data sets.

Speedb is a 100% RocksDB compatible, drop-in library, focused on high performance, optimized for modern storage hardware
and scale, on-premise and in the cloud. We strive to simplify the usability of complex data engines as well as stabilize
and improve performance for any use case.

* If you care a lot about performance and you're willing to miss some feature like the __len___ method,
  use [RocksDict](https://github.com/Congyuwang/RocksDict) directly.
* The save and load is a bit different from the other stores. It is not a dump and load of the data, save to a file and
  ingest back.
* Requirements:   
  ```pip install speedict```

```python

## [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb)

RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering Team. It is built on earlier work on LevelDB by
Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com) and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast key-value server, especially suited for storing
data on flash drives. It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs between
Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF) and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has
multi-threaded compactions, making it especially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a single database.

* If you care a lot about performance and you're willing to miss some feature like the __len___ method,
  use [RocksDict](https://github.com/Congyuwang/RocksDict) directly.
* Only one instance can be open at a time for threading locking issues.
* The save and load is a bit different from the other stores. It is not a dump and load of the data, save to a file and
  ingest back.

* Requirements:   
  ```pip install rocksdict```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import RocksDBStore

store = RocksDBStore.open('directory/')

store.save('file.sst')
# load 
store.ingest('file.sst')

```

## [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb)

LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to
string values.

Important notes:

* In strict=True, LevelDB Only handles bytes, so you need to encode your data before saving it strict=False will do that
  for you.

Requirements:

* Install LevelDB on your platform and also

```
pip install plyvel
# or 
pip install plyvel-ci
```

```python
from spoonbill.datastores import LevelDBStore

store = LevelDBStore.open('directory/')

```
